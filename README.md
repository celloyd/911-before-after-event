# 911-before-after-event
Compares rate of Seattle PD calls to 911 before and after an event by beat, sector, or precinct

Currently very much in development; tidy version of things zipped into a function will probably happen eventually. Does not yet raise errors when inappropriate values are fed in.

Call data that notebook uses can be found at https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Call-Data/33kz-ixgy; download the .csv to use the program as it is currently.
environment.yml can be used to set up the use environment if you're on a Mac running OS X (and probably a pretty recent one); manually update the prefix to what you need it to be.
req.txt will tell you what you need to run the call data notebook.
