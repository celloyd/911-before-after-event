For that reason, I'm going to create a \"Call Source\" column with values \"external\" (TELEPHONE OTHER, NOT 911; 911; ALARM CALL (NOT POLICE ALARM); POLICE (VARDA) ALARM; IN PERSON COMPLAINT; and TEXT MESSAGE), \"internal\" (ONVIEW, PROACTIVE (OFFICER INITIATED), and SCHEDULED EVENT (RECURRING)), and \"error\" (HISTORY CALL (RETRO) and FK ERROR).\n",

    "Let's start by using geopandas. A necessary future improvement will be to have the program automatically pull the appropriate beat, but first I need to get to the basic visualization.\n",

    "One critical issue is that the order of beats in the geodataframe doesn't match the order of beats I've been working with, and I have no reason to believe that beat order will be consistent across the shapefiles. For that reason, it makes sense to append the percentage change values to the geodataframe by calling the appropriate value from the percentage change dataframe. This kind of iteration is decidedly slow on dataframes in general, but we're also working with <100 entries, so it's not a real problem compared with reading in the data and assembling the within_window dataframe."
