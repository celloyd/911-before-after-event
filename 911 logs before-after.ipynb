For that reason, I'm going to create a \"Call Source\" column with values \"external\" (TELEPHONE OTHER, NOT 911; 911; ALARM CALL (NOT POLICE ALARM); POLICE (VARDA) ALARM; IN PERSON COMPLAINT; and TEXT MESSAGE), \"internal\" (ONVIEW, PROACTIVE (OFFICER INITIATED), and SCHEDULED EVENT (RECURRING)), and \"error\" (HISTORY CALL (RETRO) and FK ERROR).\n",

    "However, I want the proto-dashboard I show people to be as interesting as possible, and one of the major underlying hypotheses of this project is that certain events may affect \"crime\" (as measured by requests for SPD assistance), but probably only specific types of crime.\n",
    "I would expect a homeless encampment moving in to result in a spike in calls for suspicious persons, drugs, and drunk & disorderly. It might also result in an increase in property crime. I would not expect it to affect traffic calls, and I hope it won't affect violent crime - that's probably the biggest and most important question I'm trying to answer here.\n",
